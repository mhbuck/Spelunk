#Spelunk
This is a repo playing around with the idea of having an interface which is part of the Core project. Initially the implimentation is part of the application. My aim is to swap it to use an API using the Refit Library (https://github.com/xpaulbettsx/refit) and have the API and MVC application work of the same interface

Tasks:
* Create base application - Done
* Move to using tasks
* Move to using refit with web api.
